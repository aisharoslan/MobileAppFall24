# Initial Midterm Concept (To-Do List)

## Idea 1:

### Cooking To-Do List

- Target User: Anyone interested in cooking
- App storing recipes saved by the user or imported from online (web scraping)
- User can choose which recipe to cook based on ingredients/cuisine/mealtime
- To-Do List will walk user step by step through the cooking process and user can check off each step
- Pantry Profile to store available ingredients
- Reward/Trophy for completing a recipe
- Favorite/Rate recipes
- Can recalculate portions based on how much can feed

## Idea 2:

### Technical Interview To-Do List

- Target User: Anyone preparing for technical interviews
- Reminds user of daily technical interview question/concept to answer/research
- Provides roadmap to-do list for user to understand concepts based on role (Frontend, Backend, ML, etc)
- Breaks up main concepts in each role for user to cover, prioritization based on user preferences
- Notification reminders

## Idea 3:

### Project To-Do List

- Target User: Students/Entrepreneurs
- App storing projects ongoing/planned by user
- Separates each card by project, each project will have its own to-do list
- Organized by priority, category (class, personal, mobile, web etc), deadlines
- Timeline/Progress Bar for each project
- Divide by persons in charge for each part of the project
- Divide by project stages (design, development, user testing, planning etc)
- Organize by tagging, color coding
- Notification reminders

## Idea 4:

### Fun To-Do List

- Target User: Anyone looking for fun leisure activities
- Healthy Habits/Activites Suggestion List
- E.g. Water your plants today, feed your pet, skincare, try new restaurant, play pickleball etc
- Integrates with schedule and fills empty time slots with small, fun things to do
- Option to manually add task to current/future timeline
- Can make the activity a regular 'routine'
- Shows 'Today's Activities' calendar from 12am-11.59pm on the home screen

## Idea 5:

### Travel To-Do List

- Target User: Travelers
- Can divide into categories (food, monuments, hotels, tours etc) for planning before and during the trip
- Can have unique to-do list for each country, generate a template to-do list for users to cover (buy tickets, transportation, hotels etc) and they can add more if they want

- Shopping, Medication, Workout (CRUD operations like a DB)
- HW style for mobile layout
